### **Introduction**
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on quantum computing concepts and implementations using Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing software development framework. 

### **Jupyter Notebook Overview**

- **Project Notebook:** This notebook provides a detailed exploration of Deutsch's Algorithm, a foundational quantum computing algorithm. It includes an introduction to the problem solved by Deutsch's Algorithm, a comparison of quantum and classical approaches, implementation details using Qiskit, and simulation results.

- **Tasks Notebook:** This notebook contains various tasks dedicated to exploring fundamental tasks in quantum computing.

### **Installation Setup Guide**

The following is a step by step guide on how you can clone this repository down on to your own machine and get it running. Please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before continuing.

### **Prerequisites**
Installation of `git` <br>
Installation of `Python 3` (versions 3+)
or
Installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)<br>
Installation of `Visual Studio Code`, with extension `Jupyter`

### **Step 1: Clone Repository:** 
In order to clone the github repository, use the following command:<br>
git clone https://github.com/The-Mad-Ryanosaurus/Emerging-Technologies.git<br>
This link can be found in the code button at the top of this page under the HTTPS tab.


### **Step 2: Install Project Dependencies:**
In the same terminal window you used to clone the repository, do the following step by step:
1. cd Emerging-Technologies
2. `pip install notebook`
3. `pip install qiskit`
4. `pip install qiskit-aer`
5. `pip install matplotlib` 


### **Step 3: Open Project in Visual Studio Code:**
Still in the same terminal window do the following:
code .
This will open VS code and you can now access and run both jupyter notebooks.
